# CS231
**Assembly Language and Digital Circuits - CSUSM**

*Pre-requisite for CS231 -- CS111*

***Course Overview:*** The structure of computers, number and character representation, word and instruction formats, and flowcharting.  Machine and assembly language programming, address modification, indexing, indirect addressing, subroutines, and mnemonic interpreting systems.  Includes digital logic, analysis and synthesis of circuits, and circuits of commonly used computer components. 

**Course Description:** 

•	Describe major components of computer processor architecture and representation of data in memory. 

•	Implement arithmetic, comparison, branching, repetition, I/O, and bit operations and procedures in assembly language programs. 

•	Convert numbers between decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal representations, and represent negative numbers using common formats. 

•	Apply digital logic components including gates, circuits, flip-flops, and a finite state machine 

•	Articulate that there are many equivalent representations of computer functionality, including logical expressions and gates, and be able to use mathematical expressions to describe the functions of simple combinational and sequential circuits. 

•	Design the basic building blocks of a computer: arithmetic-logic unit (gate-level), registers (gate-level), memory (register transfer-level). 

•	Describe the internal representation of non-numeric data, such as characters, strings, records, and arrays. 

•	Write simple programs at the assembly/machine level for string processing and manipulation
